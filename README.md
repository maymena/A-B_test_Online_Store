# A-B_test_Online_Store

## Task statement

You've received an analytical task from an international online store. Your predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left only the technical specifications and the test results.

## Technical description

Groups: А (control), B (new payment funnel)

Launch date: 2020-12-07

The date when they stopped taking up new users: 2020-12-21

End date: 2021-01-01

Audience: 15% of the new users from the EU region

Purpose of the test: testing changes related to the introduction of an improved recommendation system

purchases (purchase). At each of the stage of the funnel product_page → product_card → purchase, there will be at least a 10% increase.
